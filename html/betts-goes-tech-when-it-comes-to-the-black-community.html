                    <h4>Betts Goes Tech When It Comes To The Black Community
                    </h4>

                    <div class="entry-content">

                        <p>LOS ANGELES — Technically
                            speaking, Cassie Betts is a geek.</p>



                       <p>The founder of the tech company <a href="http://www.district2.co/">District2.Co</a> and the founder and CEO of
                        <a href="http://misla.org/">MISLA</a> (Made in South LA) doesn’t run away from the moniker. In fact, it’s part of her self-description that she admittedly wears like a badge of honor.
                       </p>

                        <p>“Yes, I’m a geek,” said
                            Betts, who was born in Inglewood, moved to Pontiac, Illinois before moving to
                            Honolulu and eventually back to Los Angeles. “I’m a nerd and that’s OK. It
                            works for me.”</p>



                        <p>Founded in 2013,&nbsp;District2.Co&nbsp;is a business-to-business tech company that connects
                            brands and designers with factories to better automate the manufacturing
                            process. The company came out of both&nbsp;the South Los Angeles incubator
                            through Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corporation and Silicon Beach’s
                            Stubbs Alderton &amp; Makiles Precelerator (a program for startups).</p>



                        <p>MISLA, designed to bring
                            stimulus to Betts’ community is an urban economic accelerator that trains
                            underrepresented minorities in web development, software engineering and other
                            forms of digital literacy.</p>



                        <p>“I started MISLA as a result of the current political and economic
                            state of affairs,” Betts said. “Hashtags like&nbsp;#blacklivesmatter and
                            #aDayWithoutImmigrants have brought&nbsp;the minority struggle to the forefront
                            of American politics in recent years.”&nbsp;</p>



                        <p>A huge fan of technology,
                            robots, computers and calculus, Betts, a divorced, single mother of two boys
                            began her road to all that was technical when she was young. By the time she
                            was 9, she had already taught herself how to code, mostly because she wanted to
                            play computer games.</p>



                        <p>“My father told me if I
                            wanted to play them, I had to program them into the computer.”</p>



                        <p>That knowledge would prove
                            to be invaluable as Betts, a serial entrepreneur who attended a six-week boot
                            camp at Code District (a web and mobile app development company), would
                            eventually use coding on several projects.</p>



                        <p>“Attending Code District
                            was the greatest decision of my life,” said Betts, who got her entrepreneurial
                            spirit honestly. Her father, a one-time Illinois state trooper, also had a real
                            estate business.</p>



                        <p>“He was&nbsp;extremely
                            prolific in investments,” Betts said. “When I was 11, I helped
                            my dad manage the business. We had more than 150 units. I took care of all the
                            administrative work, collected rent, dealt with complaints and sent maintenance
                            people to fix repairs.”</p>



                        <p>It turned out, that the
                            “maintenance” team was basically Betts and her family.&nbsp;</p>



                        <p>“We did everything,” she
                            said. “We painted, fixed the plumbing, and did the electrical work. I
                            absolutely hated this life, but I definitely learned a lot. It was preparing
                            me. It formed the foundation for my life as a serial entrepreneur.”</p>



                        <p>In 2000, after graduating
                            from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, Betts started a
                            clothing line and a photography business. A career in fashion had been a dream
                            of hers ever since she was a kid.</p>



                        <p>Although she’s not one for
                            “clocking in,” and even though she doesn’t like cubicles, Betts threw herself
                            into the fashion industry because she wanted to work her way up the corporate
                            ladder. She worked with designer Jerry Leigh on his kids’ designs. While there
                            she created a jeans line for Boom Boom Jeans, a junior fashion brand under Blue
                            Planet.</p>



                        <p>Once on the inside of the
                            business, she quickly noticed that the industry’s technology was outdated. Her
                            goal was to upgrade the manufacturing process. Eventually, she realized the
                            need for sourcing manufacturers, which led to the launch of&nbsp;District2.Co.&nbsp;</p>



                        <p>There was a method to her
                            madness. Betts, 41, had a plan. Her role all along, as she saw it, was and
                            still is to advocate for women and minority-owned businesses.</p>



                        <p>“What really pushed me was
                            when I got into tech in 2013, there were hardly any women and even less black
                            women,” Betts said. “Most of the time, I would be the only black person in the
                            room. That would happen at 98% of the events I went to. I’ve always been about
                            Black Girl Magic. I’m that person.”</p>



                        <p>Betts got where she is
                            today because of other women of color “hooking” her up with information on
                            financing, funding and resources.</p>



                        <p>Admittedly, her life, at times
                            was rocky.</p>



                        <p>Homeless at 19, Betts
                            credits several local organizations with helping her find her way and get on
                            her feet.</p>



                        <p>She slept on friends’
                            couches, in a car at a mechanic’s shop, on bus stop benches and cardboard boxes
                            — sometimes while still attending high school.</p>



                        <p>Eventually, she got into acting and modeling in Coca-Cola&nbsp;commercials as well as television and film. Those breaks allowed her to continue her dream. She hasn’t looked back.</p>



                        <p>She became a founding
                            member of Black Women in Tech.</p>



                        <p>“I want to make sure there
                            is a seat at the table for us,” she said.</p>



                        <p>She also co-produces Urban
                            Tech Connect — an annual tech conference headed by Plugin South LA, and
                            is&nbsp;a volunteer pitch coach and lead consultant for the Youth
                            Entrepreneurial Challenge put on by the Vermont Slauson Economic Development
                            Corporation.</p>



                        <p>From 2014-16, she partnered
                            with the Positive Results Co. and the Soledad Enrichment Action to create a
                            youth initiative that gives inner-city youth on-the-job training. The center
                            was located on the second floor of a building on Manchester Boulevard and
                            Vermont Avenue.</p>



                        <p>“[County Supervisor] Mark
                            Ridley Thomas gave the school $50,000 to aesthetically design the second floor
                            and for technology and design,” Betts said. “We did coding, made commercials
                            and we trained the youth in the school and from the neighborhood.</p>



                        <p>In a 2017 article, Forbes magazine
                            called her “The Woman Turning South LA into Startup Land.” She is
                            the&nbsp;promoter and visionary behind the South LA Best Buy Teen Tech Center,
                            scheduled to open this summer in partnership with the Vermont Slauson Economic Development
                            Corporation, Annenberg Tech, and PledgeLA.</p>



                        <p>And she’s not done yet.
                            Betts, who writes a secret blog on dating and is involved in a travel website
                            for black women, is always looking for ways to increase her profile and that of
                            the community she champions.</p>



                        <p>“We
                            have plans to launch a tech accelerator to provide funding, and services to
                            existing and new startups in the South L.A. community,” Betts said. “Our aim is
                            to decrease the tech diversity gap, increasing economic stability within
                            poverty-stricken communities and battling the effects of gentrification.”</p>
