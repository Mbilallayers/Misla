                        <p>
                            When I was a JR/SR in high school, I told my school counselor I wanted to apply for the local University‚Äôs gifted program. She discouraged me, saying something to the effect of ‚Äúyou have to be reallllly, realllly smart to take college courses while still in high school, honey.‚Äù She refused to sign off on it, even though I had a 4.5, (yes... 4.5 because advance placement English was worth 5.0 credits). I can still see her face of utter shock and horror that this lil Black girl would have the AUDACITY to aim so high. I left her office in near tears. But I still applied. I had to take some crazy insane test which I passed and at age 16/17 was taking classes at the University of Hawaii via some special gifted program.

                        </p>
                        <p>                        I think we‚Äôve established that I had the absolute worst school counselor. My father was out the picture, and though my mom was very sweet, she gave me no guidance on how college worked as she was busy navigating her own life.
                        </p>
                        <p>                        I didn‚Äôt know I actually had to APPLY to go to college. Being that I was always a straight A student, I thought they would just come get me ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è...
                        </p>
                        <p>                        At the very last minute, I randomly applied to a few schools knowing absolutely nothing about them other than the fact that I read somewhere that they were top notch.
                        </p>
                        <p>                        I was accepted into Stanford. When I looked at the tuition, I just cried and threw the letter away. Did I know about financial aide? Nope. Scholarships? Nope. Did anyone tell me? Nope.
                        </p>
                        <p>                        Fast forward a few years later, and getting fresh out of homelessness in Los Angeles, CA. I applied for the Fashion School of Design and Merchandising (FIDM), as it was always my dream to become a Fashion Designer. I met with an admissions counselor, he gave me a tour of the campus and I fell in love. In his office I started the application process, there was an application fee just to apply. I believe $1000 or so, hell, it could‚Äôve been $100. Either way, I was living in transitional housing in a program with The Salvation Army. I didn‚Äôt have it. Then he showed me the tuition and my heart just sank.
                        </p>
                        <p>                        I went home. Cried again and tried to figure out my next move that would shape the rest of my life. A week later I get a call from another admissions counselor. He asked why I didn‚Äôt apply to FIDM. I told him because it was too expensive. He tells me that based off me being Magna cum laude at my high school. I should be able to get in on partial or full scholarship. I‚Äôm 20 years old and this is my FIRST time hearing any of this yall! üò´üò´üò´
                        </p>
                        <p>                        I will NEVER forget that school counselor. His name was James Bontemps (now deceased). He was a Black man with a southern/ metro swag. When I told him I didn‚Äôt even have the money to apply he nicknamed me ‚ÄúPo Chile‚Äù said he would handle it, and that I better become somebody.
                        </p>
                        <p>                        Long story short. I‚Äôm now a proud graduate of FIDM and went on to become founder of a pretty cool Fashion Tech company. My work now with MISLA, MARTY, VSEDC‚Äôs Best Buy Teen Trch Center in South Central and The Annenberg Foundation is focused on alternative and innovative education, training, and social mobility for inner city youth. Knowing how the world works and having mentorship and support really is half the battle.
                        </p>
                        <p>                        I don‚Äôt regret missing out on my Stanford opportunity based on my ignorance of life, because everything happens for a reason. If I had went to Stanford, I would have missed ‚Äúthe struggle‚Äù. It was that struggle that molded me into the woman I am today. And this woman right here, is pretty frickin awesome. ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
